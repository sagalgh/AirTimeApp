# AirTime


## Introduction & Inspiration

Our goal for this project is to  create something that makes everyone’s lives a touch easier. 

Airports can be frustrating and overwhelming. Travelling to new places, travelling on your own or with family, airports are one of the most stressful places to be. They are large, hard to navigate, often have restaurants and other amenities tucked into corners that are hard to find. Maybe you want to exchange some money, or go to a gift shop, but do not want to roman the airport aimlessly with all of your baggage and belongings. That is why we created AirTime.
